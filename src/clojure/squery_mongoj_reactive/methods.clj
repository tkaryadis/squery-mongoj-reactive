;;squery-mongo doesn't wrap the driver methods one by one (it has commands, that some wrap methds like q wraps .aggregate)
;;uses squery arguments and interop directly
;;here is an alternative by using a general m macro wrapper that converts squery arguments to java arguments
;;but its not used in general, but still its an option as alternative of squery arguments
